- Add parsing of data constuctors
- Pattern matching
- Typechecking overhaul
- Ability to add data types
- If something is not defined in a function, check and see if it defined later in the same file
  - error if something is defined twice at the top level?
- Type annotations
- Redo type inference in perperation for ADTs and typclasses

PLAN:
    - Redo parsing to have a seperate lexing stage
    - Let recs with multiple functions
    - Temporarily get rid of type inference in order to make adding algebriac datatypes easier
    - Add type annotations
    - Reimplement type inference Using Algorithm W modified to allow algebriac datatypes
Somewhere in there redefine the `Env`s to be more clear. Additonally, add valid types to the enviroment for interpretation.
All of the top level functions should be added to the enviroment at once perhaps?

Maybe use a Map instead of a tuple?
