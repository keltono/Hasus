- Add parsing of data constuctors
- lets with multiple defintions/ mutual recusion
- Typechecking overhaul
- Type annotations
- What types are valid when
- Ability to add data types
- Recusive datatypes
- Seperate lexing/parsing stages
- If something is not defined in a function, check and see if it defined later in the same file
  - error if something is defined twice at the top level?

PLAN:
    - Redo parsing to have a seperate lexing stage
    - Let recs with multiple functions
    - Temporarily get rid of type inference in order to make adding algebriac datatypes easier
    - Add type annotations
    - Reimplement type inference Using Algorithm W modified to allow algebriac datatypes
